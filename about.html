        <h1>Why Mentura Was Started</h1>

        <p>
          Mentura was created with one mission: to make real, honest, student-to-student
          guidance accessible to every student, regardless of background or connections.
          Growing up, I was fortunate enough to have an older brother, someone who understood
          my end goals and helped me every step of the way. Wanting to go into a lucrative field,
          I always had questions which I bombarded him with, and I was so lucky to have an older
          brother to ask these questions too. Fast forward a few years, it came to sixth form,
          and I had someone there telling me how to standout in my applications, someone who
          was brutually honest and gave me real advice, someone who had been through the process
          of going to a top University. I was fortunate enough to get into The University of Warwick,
          and I decided to start posting on a channel called CashFlowClub, all about educational videos
          and a way for me to try help students whose shoes I was in not too long ago, receiving 100s of
          messages asking for advice, I felt grateful but I understood that I can't give tailored advice
          to everyone, and that is why Mentura was built. Mentura allows you to ask those burning questions
          to people who are doing, what you want to do.
        </p>

        <h1>Why Mentura?</h1>

        <p>
          We connect you with real university students, degree apprentices, and interns
          who understand your journey because they’ve lived it. No generic or AI-generated advice,
          only real experience, real insight, and real support. Sure, you can go to a networking event and get
          two minutes with an Apprentice or Undergrad, or spend your whole evening cold messaging people on
          LinkedIn for zero replies. We are cutting this out - for good.
        </p>

        <h1>Our Mission</h1>

        <p>
          Our goal is simple:
          <strong>Make opportunity accessible.</strong>
